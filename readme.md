# Persona Chef: Your Personal Recipe Assistant

## Overview

Persona Chef is an intelligent recipe assistant that personalizes cooking recommendations based on your preferences, dietary restrictions, and available ingredients. Whether you're a seasoned chef or a cooking novice, Persona Chef adapts to your unique culinary persona to provide tailored recipe suggestions, cooking tips, and meal planning assistance.

## Features

- **Personalized Recipe Recommendations**: Get recipe suggestions based on your taste preferences, cooking skill level, and dietary needs
- **Ingredient-Based Search**: Find recipes using ingredients you already have in your kitchen
- **Dietary Restriction Support**: Easily filter recipes for various diets (vegan, gluten-free, keto, etc.)

## How It Works

The Persona Chef system uses a combination of machine learning algorithms and nutritional databases to create a personalized cooking experience:

1. **User Profiling**: Creates a culinary persona based on your preferences, restrictions, and cooking habits
2. **Recipe Matching**: Uses collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation algorithms to find recipes that match your profile
3. **Ingredient Analysis**: Analyzes your available ingredients to suggest recipes that minimize waste and shopping needs
4. **Nutritional Optimization**: Ensures meal plans meet your nutritional requirements while respecting your taste preferences
